# ArraySubApp

The ArraySubApp project is a console application that involves working with arrays and lists. The program allows the user to select an index from an array or a list and displays the corresponding value. It also handles scenarios where the selected index doesn't exist.

# Project Description

The ArraySubApp project focuses on utilizing one-dimensional arrays and lists to store and retrieve values based on user input. The program prompts the user to select an index and displays the value at that index, ensuring proper handling of scenarios where the selected index is out of bounds.

# Instructions

Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to interact with two different data structures: an array of strings and a list of strings.

Array of Strings:

Create a one-dimensional array of strings.

The program will prompt the user to select an index of the array.

If the selected index is within the bounds of the array, the program will display the string at that index.

If the selected index is out of bounds, the program will display a message indicating that the index doesn't exist.

Array of Integers:

Create a one-dimensional array of integers.

The program will prompt the user to select an index of the array.

If the selected index is within the bounds of the array, the program will display the integer at that index.

If the selected index is out of bounds, the program will display a message indicating that the index doesn't exist.
List of Strings:

Create a list of strings.

The program will prompt the user to select an index of the list.

If the selected index is within the bounds of the list, the program will display the content at that index.

If the selected index is out of bounds, the program will display a message indicating that the index doesn't exist.

After displaying the value corresponding to the selected index, the program will conclude.
